# Web-Scraper

Web scraper using Python and the library BeautifulSoup

# Functionality

We extract both the URLs and text of all the links on the page and store them in a list of dictionaries.

We extract the text from specific elements, such as headings (h1, h2, h3) on the page and store them in a list.
We save the extracted data (links and their text) to a CSV file named "web_data.csv" using the csv module.

# UI 

Created a User interface for the web scraper application using a Python GUI framework Tkinter.
